| --------------------- | ----------- |
| **Training Box Loss** | 0.481       |
| **Training Class Loss** | 0.225       |
| **Training DFL Loss**   | 0.880       |
| **Validation Box Loss** | 0.588       |
| **Validation Class Loss** | 0.238       |
| **Validation DFL Loss**   | 0.931       |

## 2. Validation Metrics

The model's performance was evaluated on a validation set, achieving high precision and recall. The final mAP scores indicate a robust and accurate model.

### Detailed Validation Results

| Metric              | Value   |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| **Precision (B)**   | 99.5%   |
| **Recall (B)**      | 99.0%   |
| **mAP@.50 (B)**     | 99.4%   |
| **mAP@.50-.95 (B)** | 88.2%   |

These metrics confirm that the model can accurately detect helmets with high confidence and localization accuracy.

## 3. Inference Performance

Inference speed is critical for real-time applications. The following metrics were recorded from the `advanced_test.py` script, which simulates a real-world deployment scenario.

### Inference Speed

| Metric                | Value       |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| **Frames Per Second (FPS)** | ~30 FPS     |
| **Inference Time**    | ~33 ms/frame|

*Note: Inference speed can vary depending on the hardware (CPU/GPU) and input resolution.*

## 4. Conclusion

The quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the trained YOLOv8s model is highly effective for real-time helmet detection. It achieves excellent precision, recall, and mAP scores while maintaining a high inference speed suitable for deployment in production environments. The stable training performance and strong validation results confirm the model's reliability and accuracy.
