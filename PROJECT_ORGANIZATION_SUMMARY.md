### 🧹 Cleanup Actions Performed

#### ✅ Files Organized:
- ✅ **6 datasets** moved from `Data/` to `data/raw/`
- ✅ **Processed data** moved to `data/processed/`
- ✅ **All scripts** moved to `scripts/` folder
- ✅ **Documentation** moved to `docs/` folder
- ✅ **YOLO models** moved to `models/pretrained/`

#### ✅ Files Removed:
- ✅ **Unnecessary text files** (*.txt)
- ✅ **Duplicate files** in root directory
- ✅ **Empty folders** cleaned up
- ✅ **Temporary files** removed

#### ✅ Files Created:
- ✅ **Professional README.md** with complete documentation
- ✅ **Updated main.py** with menu system
- ✅ **Organized folder structure**

### 🚀 How to Use the Organized Project

#### 1. **Start the Application:**
```bash
python main.py
```

#### 2. **Available Options:**
1. **Professional Helmet Detection** (Recommended)
2. **Simple Test**
3. **Camera Test**
4. **Exit**

#### 3. **Access Scripts Directly:**
```bash
# Professional detection system
python scripts/advanced_test.py

# Simple test
python scripts/simple_test.py

# Camera test
python scripts/test_camera.py
```

### 📊 Project Statistics

- **Total Scripts**: 6 organized scripts
- **Datasets**: 6 raw datasets organized
- **Models**: Pre-trained and custom models organized
- **Documentation**: 4 comprehensive docs
- **Configuration**: 4 config files organized

### 🎯 Key Benefits of Organization

1. **🔍 Easy Navigation**: Clear folder structure
2. **📚 Comprehensive Documentation**: All docs in one place
3. **🚀 Simple Execution**: Single entry point via main.py
4. **🧹 Clean Environment**: No unnecessary files
5. **📦 Modular Structure**: Scripts separated by function
6. **🔧 Professional Setup**: Ready for development and deployment

### 🏆 Project Status: READY FOR USE

The HSE Vision Professional Helmet Detection System is now:
- ✅ **Fully Organized**
